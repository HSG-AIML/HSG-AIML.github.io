This website presents research results of the [Artificial Intelligence
and Machine Learning [AI:ML]](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-aiml-borth/)
lab at the [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/).

Our deep neural networks research focuses on
representation learning through supervised and unsupervised approaches
with applications to text-to-speech generation, computer vision and
remote sensing, and financial time-series data.
