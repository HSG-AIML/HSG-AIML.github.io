description="Example images and class activation maps for two coal
power plants from our sample that were correctly identified. The
heatmap plots highlight areas on which the trained model bases its
class prediction. In this case, the model focuses on the presence of
coal heaps that are indeed indicative of coal-powered plants." %} The
industrial and power-generating economic sectors emit more than half
of the annually and globally released greenhouse gas emissions,
strongly contributing to global warming effects. In our recent work
([Mommert et
al. 2020](https://hsg-aiml.github.io/2020/11/24/Characterization_of_Industrial_Smoke_Plumes_from_Remote_Sensing_Data.html))
we laid the foundation to estimating greenhouse gas emissions from
industrial sites by characterizing industrial smoke plumes from remote
imaging data only. That work is part of a bigger effort to estimate
greenhouse gas emission rates from satellite imagery for individual
industrial sites.  In this work, we made one further step towards
achieving this goal.

Different industrial sites contribute very differently to emission
inventories. For instance, light industrial plants typically produce less
greenhouse gas emissions than coal-powered power plants. It
is prudent to account for the nature of industrial sites when trying
to estimate their emission budget.

In this work, we investigate the possibility to identify different
types of power plants from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.  We
distinguish between 10 different power plant types: fossil-fuel driven
power plants utilizing brown coal, gas, or hard coal, nuclear power
plants and power plants utilizing regenerative energy sources
involving water (run-of-river, reservoir and pumped storage designs),
solar, and wind.

Using a ResNet-50 deep learning model, we are able to achieve a mean
accuracy of 90.0% in distinguishing 10 different power plant types and
a background class that contains random satellite image tiles. We also
find that we are able to identify the cooling mechanisms utilized in
thermal power plants with a mean accuracy of 87.5%.  A confusion
matrix (see below) reveals the limitations of our approach: the degree
of confusion is highest for power plants that utilize similar energy
source (e.g., hydro-electric plants) or reside in similar geographic
settings. This shortcoming can likely be addressed with a larger
training data set - this study is based on 4,154 images of 450
different power plants grouped in 10 different power plant types.
Finally, we utilize class activation maps to improve the
interpretability of our results and find that our trained model takes
advantage of unique features of different power plant types: oil
storage structures, coal heaps, wind turbines, or dams.

Our results enable us to qualitatively investigate the energy mix from
Sentinel-2 imaging data, and prove the feasibility to classify
industrial sites on a global scale from freely available satellite
imagery. Motivated by the success of this work, we will extend it in
the future to classify a more diverse set of industrial sites. In
addition to socio-economic applications, such a classifier will
support us in estimating greenhouse gas emissions for any industrial
site on Earth from remote imaging data.
