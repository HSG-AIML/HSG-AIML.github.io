title: Knowledge Extraction from Remote Sensing with Deep Neural Networks
layout: page
---

Remote Sensing satellites generate vast amounts of data over a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The 
analysis of these data and the focused extraction of useful knowledge from them exceeds the capabilities of most
traditional analysis methods. In the recent years, deep neural networks have shown promising results in learning 
to extract knowledge from remote sensing data, which is a result of their capacity and flexibility.

In our lab, we are utilizing a range of state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to solve different tasks
like classification from images, regression, semantic segmentation, and object detection.
