We offer thesis projects on a Bachelor and Master level for the different [research topics](/research)
of our lab on a regular basis. 

Thesis projects can be of *theoretical* or *applied* nature. Theoretical projects focus more on fundamental research,
e.g., implementing and investigating new methods; 
topics might be more abstract and might require additional skills like higher mathematics. 
Applied projects will apply existing methods to new problems or data sets, or they involve the generation of novel 
data sets related to specific problems. 


While we are open to accepting students 
with diverse academic backgrounds, we require good Python coding skills from all candidates.


# What we offer

Students are considered full members of our lab community. They partake in our regular lab meetings 
and are invited to join other lab activities, as well. We maintain an informal but professional work environment. 
Our lab community is highly diverse and open-minded; Geeks are welcome!
